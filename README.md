# IoT_privacy
A project on preserving data privacy with applications in the Internet of Things (IoT)

## Note
1. The training algorithm in the 'baseline' folder still imports some utility functions from the helper file 'mine.py', which has been recently integrated into the file 'utils.py', and thus it cannot run properly.
